// binary tree is a hirarchial data structure with childrens to each parents 
// each node in binary tree have left and right referances along data element
//topmost node is root 
//elements with no children are leaves
//example file system in computer
//* full binary tree each tree have either 2 or 0 childern
//* completely filled binary tree all levels are filled execpt last one 
//* perfect binary tree (symmetry ) all nodes have two children and laeves are at same level
// *balanced bianry tree height = o(log n)
//degenerate one child only (pathalogical)
